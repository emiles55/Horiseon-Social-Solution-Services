# Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services
This is the revised content for the Horiseon webpage

User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.

In addition to making these changes, the CSS file was commented on, and the CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized.
